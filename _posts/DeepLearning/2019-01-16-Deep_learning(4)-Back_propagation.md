In the previous post, the topic is about the how neural networks work. In this post,  i will introduce the way to learn the neural network.

In learning process, we will compute the `cost function`.

## Learning Neural Network

There are three ways to develop the algorithms.

1.  Algorithm by human
2.  Extracting feature by human's algorithm, use Machine Learning algorithm.
3.  Use Deep Learning





### Loss function

`Loss function` is one of index to show the performance of model. The reason why we use loss function instead of using accuracy, `loss function` is used for fitting the parameter in `Back propagation process`.

`Loss function` is useful to get the partial derivative of weight variables.



#### Mean squared error(MSE)

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}\sum_k(y_k - t_k)^2
$$

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{If data size is N,}\\  
&E = -\frac{1}{2N}\sum_n \sum_k(y_k - t_k)^2
\end{align}
$$





#### Cross entropy error(CEE)

$$
E = -\sum_k t_k\log y_k
$$

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{If data size is N,}\\  
&E = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_n\sum_k t_k\log y_k 
\end{align}
$$


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\vdots \\
0
\end{bmatrix}^T
\times
\ \begin{bmatrix}
0.6 \\
0.01 \\
\vdots \\
0.4
\end{bmatrix} = -1 \times \log 0.6 = 0.51
$$


### Mini-batch learning

The data size is too big, we can use batch processing. Also, In learning process, we can use batch for learing called `mini-batch`. To reduce the learning time, we can select random sample from traing data set. Then the seleted random data set will be used for training samples.



## Optimization

$$
f(x_0,x_1) = x_0^2+x_1^2
$$

The blue point is small point that has smallest value. We called it as `Saddle point`



How can we find this point automatically?



Using derivative, you can find the value to be getting close to `saddle point`





#### Derivative

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}
$$

```python
def numerical_gradient(f,x):
    h = 1e-4
    grad = np.zeros_like(x)
    
    for idx in range(x.size):
        tmp_val = x[idx]
        x[idx] = tmp_val + h
        fxh1 = f(x)
        
        x[idx] = tmp_val - h
        fxh2 = f(x)
        grad[idx] = (fxh1 - fxh2) /(2*h)
        x[idx] = tmp_val
        
    return grad
```



#### Gradient descent

$$
x_0 = x_0 - \alpha \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_0}\\
x_1 = x_1 - \alpha \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}\\
$$



```python
def gradient_descent(f,init_x, lr=0.1, step_num=100):
    x = init_x
    acc_x = list()
    for i in range(step_num):
        acc_x.append(x.copy())
        grad = numerical_gradient(f, x)
        x -= lr * grad

    return x,np.array(acc_x)
```



#### Example

```python
def f(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2


init_x = np.array([-3.0, 4.0])
x, history_x = gradient_descent(f,init_x)

plt.plot( [-5, 5], [0,0], '-b')
plt.plot( [0,0], [-5, 5], '-b')
plt.plot(history_x[:,0],history_x[:,1], 'o')
np.arange()
plt.show()
```

## Back propagation

Using the multi layer perception, we can calculate the hypothesis for the XOR problem.

But how can the machine learn the weight and bias from the multilayer?

Here is a solution called `back propagation`.





The input data affect the result by passing the weights. 

Then, using chain rule, the error change the weights by passing from the last layer to first layer.



### Partial derivative



`Chain rule` is $\frac{df(g(x))}{dx}=\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg}\cdot\frac{dg}{dx}$



It is basic equation for the partial derivative.

The chain rule is an essential idea for back-propagation.



### Softmax with loss computing graph



![Softmax with loss](/assets/images/articles/DeepLearning/softmax_with_loss.png)









#### forward calculation

$$
\overset{\mathtt{a}}{\longrightarrow}
softmax
\overset{\mathtt{y_n,\hat y_n}}{\longrightarrow}
cross\ entropy
\overset{\mathtt{L}}{\longrightarrow}
$$

>   Cross entropy : $L(y,\hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n \in N}\sum_{i \in N} y_{n,i}log\hat{y}_{n,i}$
>
>   Softmax : $y_k = \frac{exp(a_k)}{\sum_{i=1}^n exp(a_i)}$



#### backward calculation

$$
\overset{\mathtt{y_n-t_n}}{\Longleftarrow}
softmax
\overset{\mathtt{-\frac{t_n}{y_n}}}{\Longleftarrow}
cross\ entropy
\overset{\mathtt{1}}{\Longleftarrow}
$$



### cost function(loss function)

We will use `CEE`  for cost function.
$$
L(y,\hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n \in N}\sum_{i \in N} y_{n,i}log\hat{y}_{n,i}
$$
We want to find the the value to get derivatie value $\frac{dL}{dx}$ for gradient descent. Using chain rule, we can compute this value easily.



![Back propagation](/assets/images/articles/DeepLearning/backprop.png)





#### Forward computing graph

$$
f_1=\log y_n\\
f_2=t_n \log y_n = t_nf_1\\
f_3=\sum_{k=1}^n t_k \log y_k = \sum_{k=1}^nf_2(y_k)\\
L = f_4 = -\sum_{k=1}^n t_k \log y_k  = -f_3
$$



#### Backward computing graph

$$
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y_n} = \frac{1}{y}\\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial f_1} = t_n\\
\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial f_2} = \frac{\partial }{\partial f_2(y_n)} \left( f_2(y_1) + \dots + f_2(y_n) \right ) = 1\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_3} = -1\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial L} =\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_4(y_n)} = 1\\

\frac{\partial L}{\partial y_n} = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_4} 
\frac{\partial f_4}{\partial f_3}
\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial f_2}
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial f_1}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y_n}
=
1 \times -1 \times 1 \times t_n \times \frac{1}{y_n} = -\frac{t_n}{y_n}
$$



To update our `weights` on the networks, we need to calculate $\frac{dL}{dw}$ how much the value affect the function. Using chain rule of partial derivative, We can derivative $L(y,\hat{y})$ by our weights $W$.



### Simple example

$$
\begin{align}
& z= x\times y\\
& \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = y\\
& \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = x\\
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
z= x + y\\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 1\\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 1\\
\end{align}
$$



```python
import numpy as np


class MulLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = None
        self.y = None
        
    
    def forward(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
        return x*y
    
    
    def backward(self, dout):
        dx = dout * self.y
        dy = dout * self.x
        
        return dx, dy
    
class AddLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def forward(self, x, y):
        return x+y
    
    def backward(self, dout):
        dx = dout * 1
        dy = dout * 1
        return dx, dy
    

if __name__=='__main__':
    apple = 100
    apple_num = 2
    orange = 150
    oragne_num = 3
    tax = 1.1

    #layers
    mul_apple_layer = MulLayer()
    mul_orange_layer = MulLayer()
    add_apple_orange_layer = AddLayer()
    mul_tax_layer = MulLayer()

    #forwad propagation
    apple_price = mul_apple_layer.forward(apple, apple_num)
    orange_price = mul_orange_layer.forward(orange, oragne_num)
    all_price = add_apple_orange_layer.forward(apple_price,orange_price)
    price = mul_tax_layer.forward(all_price, tax)

    print("Forward| Price:",price)

    #Back propagation
    dprice = 1
    dall_price, dtax = mul_tax_layer.backward(dprice)
    dapple_price, dorange_price = add_apple_orange_layer.backward(dall_price)
    dapple, dapple_num = mul_apple_layer.backward(dapple_price)
    dorange, dorange_num = mul_orange_layer.backward(dorange_price)

    print("Backward| apple price:",dapple," apple num:", dapple_num)
    print("Backward| orange price:",dorange, " orange num:",dorange_num)
    print("Backward| tax:", dtax, " all price:",dall_price)
```



#### output

```
Forward| Price: 715.0000000000001
Backward| apple price: 2.2  apple num: 110.00000000000001
Backward| orange price: 3.3000000000000003  orange num: 165.0
Backward| tax: 650  all price: 1.1
```





### Gradient check

Derivative can be used for checking error of backpropagation. Derivative is easy to make but it is slow comparing to back propagation.

It is obvious that the difference between derivative and backpropagation. If not, it might be error in our codes for back propagation or derviative.

This function is called as `Gradient check`





### The problem in the back propagation

In the case the neural network is deep, the `back propagation` can't affect the first weights.



#### Solution for this problem

>   Neural networks with many layers really could be trained well, If the weights are initialized in a clever way.



It make rebrand the name to `Deep learning`



-   Our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small.
-   Our computers were millions of times too slow.
-   We initialized the weights in a stupid way.
-   We used the wrong type of non-linearity.
